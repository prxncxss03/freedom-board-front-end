As the name says, this is a freedom board converted into a website. This is my first fullstack project using the MERN stack, this is like the manifestation of what I know as a noob. One of the challenges I faced is mostly in the front end specifically state management. I want to implement authentication soon and as well as reactions. Honestly, I have a lot of features that I want to implement however, I'm still thinking about it because it might be an overkill for a freedom board. I was also worrying that I might take forever doing this project LOL.
